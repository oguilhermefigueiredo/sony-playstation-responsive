# sony-playstation-responsive
Here is a replica of the PlayStation website, made using the first principles of web development(HTML, CSS and JavaScript).

It was pretty challenging for me, I had some annoying difficults on the meanwhile, but now I will not make the same mistakes again.

It is a responsive, mobile-friendly website that works with some unique features for large and small devices.

A menu button with a tool bar has been implemented and can only be used specifically by phone users.

On desktop devices the navigation is different, changing their color when you try to click on them.

The buy button has a subtle animation that displays an arrow when you hover over it.

During the process of planning and coding this website, I used GIT to track all my changes and attempts, to ensure that I did not commit an irreparable mistake.

My developing environment was Linux and my text editor was Visual Studio Code. 

To be more precise, I am using a virtualization platform from a windows host to get access to a guest linux. The application is called VirtualBox.
