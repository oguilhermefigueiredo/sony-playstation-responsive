 #### 🎮| Here is a *replica* of the PlayStation website, made using the first principles of web development, which are:
 
> - HTML
> - CSS
> - JavaScript

It was *quite* challenging for me, I had some annoying difficulties in the meantime, but now I won't make the **same** mistakes again.

**It is a responsive, mobile-friendly website that works with some unique features for large and small devices.**

I implemented the *'viewport'* tag in the 'head' to resize the web page to mobile phones.

**A menu button with a tool bar has been implemented and can only be used specifically by phone users.**

**On desktop devices the navigation is different, changing their color when you try to click on them.**

**The buy button has a subtle animation that displays an arrow when you hover over it.**

# How I did that

1. During the process of planning and coding this website, I used **Git** to track all my changes and attempts, to ensure that I did not commit an irreparable mistake.

2. My developing environment was **Linux** and my text editor was Visual Studio Code. 

3. To be more precise, I am using a **virtualization** platform from a windows host to get access to a guest linux. The application is called *VirtualBox*.
